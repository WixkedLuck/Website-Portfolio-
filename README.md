# Module-Challange-2
## This is challenge two for UoM Advanced CSS: Portfolio Page
For this challenge I was tasked with creating my own website portfolio while implementing various advanced styling options in css. 

- The motivation behind this project was to create a porfolio specific to me and my previous projects. Creating this website allows me to share some of my previous
works and puts them on display for others to view even on different screen sizes! 

- I built this project to become more familiar with advanced techniques in css such as @media screen and various flex box applications. Creating this website helped
me imporve my understanding of the various styling options within css and futhered my understanding of core website fundimentals.  

- This project resolves having a working portfolio for users to view my projects and capabilities as I become a stronger web developer and programmer. Students who have working portfolios, can help with getting a job while showing employers your talents and abilities. Having several projects to view is a minimum requirement to recieve possible interviews. 

- Completion of this project allowed for me to become more knowledgeable on advanced styling options within css and creation of a online portfolio.
